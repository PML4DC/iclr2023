            <p>ICLR2022 will be hosted as a fully virtual conference this year. Like the main conference <a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/format-for-the-iclr2020-virtual-conference-76716ddea640">ICLR2022 Virtual Conference</a>, our workshop will be a mix of pre-recorded talks, asynchronous engagement, and live engagement through Q&amp;A and in-person video calls. The following are important information about our virutal workshop.</p>

<p>Detialed specific instructions and FAQ about video recording, live sessions, and other virtual related issues is found <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022/VirtualConference-FAQ">here</a>. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to the organizers of this workshop.</p>

<h2 id="overall-workshop-format">Overall Workshop Format</h2>

<p>The virtual format of the workshop means that asynchronous engagement becomes a basis of the workshops so that it works across time zones and access needs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each keynote speaker, oral presenter, and presenter of an accepted poster need to pre-record a video.</li>
  <li>Each keynote speaker should prepare a 30 minutes video.</li>
  <li>Each oral speaker should prepare a 15 minutes video.</li>
  <li>Each poster presenter should prepare a 5 minutes video.</li>
  <li>Details on live interactions such as the panel discussion, live poster spotlights, and live Q&amp;A will be updated here soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="talks-and-videos">Talks and Videos</h2>

<p>We will send out invitations to each presenter into a service to record their video. Until we send the invite with detailed instructions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We suggest each presenter prepare the material for their talks, which they will eventually record as a video as soon as they get their invitations.  These videos will become part of the permanent record of the conference workshops. For poster presentations, this video takes the place of what you would communicate at an in-person poster session. Make sure it is easy to understand. Authors of accepted papers do not need to make a poster. They can use slides that help communicate their work in the most accessible way, and in the time allocated.</li>
  <li>Each presenter will need to upload the slides or share a link to them, so use only formats that can easily be shared: a PDF of your slides, link to a cloud-based presentation that is widely accessible (e.g., Google Slides, Dropbox Paper, Prezi), or on a web-page.</li>
  <li>Each presenter need to submit their videos by April 14th 2020 (anywhere on earth). This is a <em>firm</em> deadline. No extensions.</li>
</ul>
