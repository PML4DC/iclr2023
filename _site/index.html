<h3 id="practical-machine-learning-for-developing-countries-learning-under-limitedlow-resource-scenarios">Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries: learning under limited/low resource scenarios</h3>

<!--<div class="update">
        ICLR 2022 will be a fully virtual conference. While the details for remote presentation are being finalized, authors of accepted papers/posters are encouraged to view the <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022/virtual"> ICLR virtual presentation guidelines here </a> .-->

<p>The constant progress being made in artificial intelligence needs to extend across borders if we are to democratize AI in developing countries. Adapting the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods to resource constrained environments such as developing countries, is challenging in practice. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), for instance, rely on increasingly complex and large models (e.g. most models based on transformers such as BERT, VilBERT, ALBERT, and GPT-2) that are pre-trained on large corpus of unlabeled data. In most developing countries, low/limited resources makes the adoption of these breakthroughs harder. Methods such as transfer learning will not fully solve the problem either due to bias in pre-training datasets that do not reflect real test cases in developing countries as well as the prohibitive cost of fine-tuning these large models. This in turn, hinders the democratization of AI.</p>

<p>Practical Machine Learning for Developing Countries (PML4DC) workshop is a full-day event that has been running regularly for the past 3 years in row at ICLR (past events include <a href="https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2020/" target="_blank">PML4DC 2020</a>, <a href="https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2021/" target="_blank"> PML4DC 2021</a> and <a href="https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2022/" target="_blank"> PML4DC 2022</a>). PML4DC aims to foster collaborations and build a cross-domain community by featuring invited talks, panel discussions, contributed presentations (oral and poster) and round-table mixers.</p>

<p>The main goal of PML4DC is to bring together researchers and practitioners (from academia, industry and government agencies) to reflect on aspects of designing, implementing, deploying and monitoring machine learning (ML) solutions that are typical in low resource environments across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, finance, agriculture, education and natural language processing. Specifically, we encourage contributons that highlight issues related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advances in algorithms and methods tailored for problems related with data-scarcity, imbalanced representations and limited computational resource</li>
  <li>Industry practices to scale-up ML solutions in low resource settings while balancing performance and latency tradeoffs</li>
  <li>Societal and policy impacts of ML solutions in developing countries obtained via pilot studies, qualitative research, and human-in-the-loop settings.</li>
</ul>

Hamed is a Reader in Human-Centred Systems and the Director of Postgraduate Studies at the Dyson School of Design Engineering at The Faculty of Engineering, Imperial College London. He serves as a Security Science Fellow of the Institute for Security Science and Technology, leads the Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, and is an Academic Fellow of the Data Science Institute. . In his industrial role, he is a Visiting Professor and the Chief Scientist at Brave Software where he works on developing privacy-preserving analytics protocols. He is interested in User-Centred Systems, IoT, Applied Machine Learning, and Data Security & Privacy. He enjoys designing and building systems that enable better use of our digital footprint, while respecting users' privacy.

He studied for BEng/MSc/PhD at University College London and the University of Cambridge. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany, and a postdoctoral research fellow at Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge and The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, followed by few years as a Lecturer and consequently Senior Lecturer in Digital Media at Queen Mary University of London. He has spent time working and collaborating with Brave Software, Intel Research, Microsoft Research, AT&T Research, Telefonica, and Sony Europe. When not in the lab, he prefers to be on a ski slope or in a kayak.
